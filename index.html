            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced electronics engineer with a strong background in embedded systems, PCB design, and prototyping. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at Bar Ilan University, driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions and bringing ideas to life through 3D printing and other advanced technologies.</p>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From a young age, I was fascinated by technological innovation. When I was just 10 years old, I began turning my room into a smart room, installing CCTV cameras and an electric coder at the entrance. This early curiosity and initiative set the foundation for more complex and intriguing projects as I grew older. About three years ago, I built an electric skateboard from scratch, involving everything from cutting wood to creating a custom battery from lithium cells and charging controllers. Additionally, many of my projects involve programming controllers like the Arduino IDE.</p>
